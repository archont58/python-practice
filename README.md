# Python practice
In this repo I publish the code created during the study of practice python.

---
`other/array_filling.py` - The array is filled with random numbers. The length of the array is entered by the user.

`other/fix_duplicates.py` - Adding indexes to duplicates in the array.

`other/guess_number.py` - User must guess a random number. If the user gives the wrong answer, the program gives a hint. After the correct answer, the program displays the number of attempts spent.

`other/sumstr.py` - Summing the digits of a number.

`other/years_length.py` - The program receives orbital speed and orbit radius. Next it calculates the length of the year on the planet.

`other/two_sum.py` - Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
Example: Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9, Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9, return [0, 1].

`other/two_min.py` - Output two minimum list values.

`other/binary_search.py` - Implementation of a simple binary search.

`other/merge_arrays.py` - Merge two sorted arrays.

`other/remove_repeat_nums.py` - Remove duplicates from unsorted array.

`other/reverse_integer.py` - Given a 32-bit signed integer, reverse digits of an integer.

_Example 1: Input: 123 Output: 321_

_Example 2: Input: -123 Output: -321_

_Example 3: Input: 120 Output: 21._

Note: Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: [−231,  231 − 1]. For the purpose of this problem, assume that your function returns 0 when the reversed integer overflows.

`other/roman_to_integer.py` - Convert roman numbers to integers.

---
`sort/bubble_sort.py` - Implementing Bubble Sort.

`sort/heap_sort.py` - Implementing Heap Sort.

`sort/insertion_sort.py` - Implementing Insertion Sort.
