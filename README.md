# Python practice
In this repo I publish the code created during the study of practice python.

---
`other/array_filling.py` - The array is filled with random numbers. The length of the array is entered by the user.

`other/fix_duplicates.py` - Adding indexes to duplicates in the array

`other/guess_number.py` - User must guess a random number. If the user gives the wrong answer, the program gives a hint. After the correct answer, the program displays the number of attempts spent.

`sort/bubble_sort.py` - Implementing Bubble Sort
