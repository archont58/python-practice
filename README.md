# Python practice
In this repo I publish the code created during the study of practice python.

---
`matplotlib/simple_graph.ipynb` - Creating a simple graph using matplotlib.

---
`other/array_filling.py` - The array is filled with random numbers. The length of the array is entered by the user.

`other/binary_search.py` - Implementation of a simple binary search.

`other/common_divisor.py` - Finding the greatest common divisor of two numbers.

`other/common_divisor_2.py` - Alternative implementation of the Greatest Common Divisor Algorithm.

`other/fix_duplicates.py` - Adding indexes to duplicates in the array.

`other/guess_number.py` - User must guess a random number. If the user gives the wrong answer, the program gives a hint. After the correct answer, the program displays the number of attempts spent.

`other/integer_to_roman.py` - Convert integers to roman numbers.

`other/longest_prefix.py` - Find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.

`other/maxsubarray.py` - Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum. Implementation using the Kadane's algorithm.

_Example:
Input: [-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4],
Output: 6.
Explanation: [4, -1, 2, 1] has the largest sum = 6._

`other/maxsubarray_2.py` - Implementation _the maxsubarray_ without using the Kadane's algorithm.

`other/merge_arrays.py` - Merge two sorted arrays.

`other/remove_duplicates.py` - Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array. Given a sorted array nums, remove the duplicates in-place such that each element appear only once and return the new length. Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

_Example 1:
Given nums = [1,1,2],
Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length._

_Example 2:
Given nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4],
Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums being modified to 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively. It doesn't matter what values are set beyond the returned length._

`other/remove_element` - Remove duplicate items.

`other/remove_repeat_nums.py` - Remove duplicates from unsorted array.

`other/reverse_integer.py` - Given a 32-bit signed integer, reverse digits of an integer.

_Example 1: Input: 123 Output: 321_

_Example 2: Input: -123 Output: -321_

_Example 3: Input: 120 Output: 21._

Note: Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: [−231,  231 − 1]. For the purpose of this problem, assume that your function returns 0 when the reversed integer overflows.

`other/roman_to_integer.py` - Convert roman numbers to integers.

`other/searchinsert.py` - Given a sorted array and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order. The implementation with using binary search algorithm.

_Example 1: Input: [1, 3, 5, 6], 5. Output: 2_

_Example 2: Input: [1, 3, 5, 6], 2. Output: 1_

_Example 3: Input: [1,3,5,6], 7. Output: 4_

_Example 4: Input: [1, 3, 5, 6], 0. Output: 0_

`other/searchinsert.py` - Alternative implementation without using binary search algorithm.

`other/strStr.py` - Return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.

_Example 1: Input: haystack = "hello", needle = "ll" Output: 2_

_Example 2: Input: haystack = "aaaaa", needle = "bba" Output: -1_

`other/sum_and_max_num_array.py` - Finding maximum number in array and sum of numbers in array with using the recursive algorithm.

`other/sumstr.py` - Summing the digits of a number.

`other/two_min.py` - Output two minimum list values.

`other/two_sum.py` - Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
Example: Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9, Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9, return [0, 1].

`other/two_sum_2.py` - Alternative implementation of the problem "Two Sum"

`other/valid_parentheses.py` - Given a string containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:

    Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
    Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.

Note that an empty string is also considered valid.

`other/years_length.py` - The program receives orbital speed and orbit radius. Next it calculates the length of the year on the planet.

`sort/binarytree.py` - Implementation BinaryTree.

`sort/bubble_sort.py` - Implementation Bubble Sort.

`sort/heap_sort.py` - Implementation Heap Sort.

`sort/insertion_sort.py` - Implementation Insertion Sort.

`sort/merge_sort.py` - Implementation Merge Sort.

`sort/quick_sort.py` - ImplementationQuick Sort.
