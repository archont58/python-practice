# Python practice
In this repo I publish the code created during the study of practice python.

---
`other/array_filling.py` - The array is filled with random numbers. The length of the array is entered by the user.

`other/fix_duplicates.py` - Adding indexes to duplicates in the array.

`other/guess_number.py` - User must guess a random number. If the user gives the wrong answer, the program gives a hint. After the correct answer, the program displays the number of attempts spent.

`other/sumstr.py` - Summing the digits of a number.

`other/years_length.py` - The program receives orbital speed and orbit radius. Next it calculates the length of the year on the planet.

`other/two_sum.py` - Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
Example: Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9, Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9, return [0, 1].

`sort/bubble_sort.py` - Implementing Bubble Sort.
