# Python practice
In this repo I publish the code created during the study of practice python.

---
`matplotlib/simple_graph.ipynb` - Creating a simple graph using matplotlib.

---
`other/array_filling.py` - The array is filled with random numbers. The length of the array is entered by the user.

`other/binary_search.py` - Implementation of a simple binary search.

`other/common_divisor.py` - Finding the greatest common divisor of two numbers.

`other/common_divisor_2.py` - Alternative implementation of the Greatest Common Divisor Algorithm.

`other/fix_duplicates.py` - Adding indexes to duplicates in the array.

`other/guess_number.py` - User must guess a random number. If the user gives the wrong answer, the program gives a hint. After the correct answer, the program displays the number of attempts spent.

`other/integer_to_roman.py` - Convert integers to roman numbers.

`other/longest_prefix.py` - Find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.

`other/merge_arrays.py` - Merge two sorted arrays.

`other/remove_element` - Remove duplicate items.

`other/remove_repeat_nums.py` - Remove duplicates from unsorted array.

`other/reverse_integer.py` - Given a 32-bit signed integer, reverse digits of an integer.

_Example 1: Input: 123 Output: 321_

_Example 2: Input: -123 Output: -321_

_Example 3: Input: 120 Output: 21._

Note: Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: [−231,  231 − 1]. For the purpose of this problem, assume that your function returns 0 when the reversed integer overflows.

`other/roman_to_integer.py` - Convert roman numbers to integers.

`other/strStr.py` - Return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.

_Example 1: Input: haystack = "hello", needle = "ll" Output: 2_

_Example 2: Input: haystack = "aaaaa", needle = "bba" Output: -1_

`other/sumstr.py` - Summing the digits of a number.

`other/two_min.py` - Output two minimum list values.

`other/two_sum.py` - Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
Example: Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9, Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9, return [0, 1].

`other/two_sum_2.py` - Alternative implementation of the problem "Two Sum"

`other/valid_parentheses.py` - Given a string containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:

    Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
    Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.

Note that an empty string is also considered valid.

`other/years_length.py` - The program receives orbital speed and orbit radius. Next it calculates the length of the year on the planet.

---
`sort/bubble_sort.py` - Implementing Bubble Sort.

`sort/heap_sort.py` - Implementing Heap Sort.

`sort/insertion_sort.py` - Implementing Insertion Sort.

`sort/merge_sort.py` - Implementing Merge Sort.

`sort/quick_sort.py` - Implementing Quick Sort.

`sort/selection_sort.py` - Implementing Selection Sort.
